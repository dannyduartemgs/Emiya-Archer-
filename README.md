I actually have some ideas for a Emiya Survivor, you can check them on the discord. I still need to learn to code tho. 

I'll probably update this once I learn how to replace the bow. In the meantime, enjoy!

If you wish to contact me here's my discord: dannyduartemgs <br />
A newbie like me could use some tips.
